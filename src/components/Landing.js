          Rohit was an invaluable member of the Project Echo leadership team due
          to his niche skillset in cloud computing and strong web development
          skills. Rohit leads by example, approaching all tasks with genuine
          enthusiasm and his refreshing sense of optimism is not easily
          diminished. He actively seeks out challenging problems and
          opportunities to hone his skills, then delivers intelligent solutions.
          He can be relied on to keep a cool head when time is tight and will go
          above and beyond when needed to support the team. Mentoring Rohit this
          past year has been very rewarding as I have seen him take feedback on
          board and apply it immediately. Rohit is certainly one to watch
          because he will be doing big things in the devops space in the near
          future.
