          Hello, I&apos;m Rohit, a 21-year-old male international student
          currently residing in Australia ðŸ¦˜. I arrived here in early 2022,
          taking advantage of the lifted COVID travel restrictions to pursue
          higher education after completing my Year 12 in Punjab, India.{" "}
          <br></br>
          <br></br> During my final years in high school (Year 11 to 12), I
          delved into various subjects such as physics, chemistry, mathematics,
          and computer science. Upon achieving a commendable high school grade
          of 94%, I found myself pondering about my next steps. Reflecting on my
          academic journey, I discovered a genuine interest in computer science
          ðŸ’», particularly drawn to the logic involved in programming, an area I
          had dabbled in during high school. <br></br>
          <br></br>The turning point occurred during the summer of 2020 when
          COVID lockdowns prompted me to explore programming independently. I
          vividly recall stumbling upon a &ldquo;Learn HTML in 60 minutes&ldquo;
          video on YouTube during a casual family dinner. Stepping outside the
          confines of the school syllabus, I found the experience refreshing and
          thoroughly enjoyable. This initial foray into HTML ignited my
          curiosity, leading me to delve deeper into web development, ultimately
          solidifying my decision to pursue a degree in Information Technology.
